### Add a model from the assets Store 👾

<br>

- ✋ Go to the store and choose a model, I will be using an **fbx** animated spider

<br>

- Once you have your model, go to your assets in the browser and click open in Unity, (if you are already connected in your unity), go to the **window > package manager** click on the top bar dropdown and choose assets, there you will see the assets, click on the one you want and download it, **once it s ready, click on import** (it will open another window, where you will chose what you want to import from the model) click again import it, now go back to your **unity assets** and check the model
