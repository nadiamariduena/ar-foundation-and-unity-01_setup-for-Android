### How to get started with UNITY

<br>

#### Install the Unity Hub

<br>

> You need this first, so that you can install the unity packages 👾

<br>

<br>

- Download the [ Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)

<br>

- click on **Download UNity Hub**

<br>

- ✋Choose a Directory (where you want the file you are going to download, to be stored)

<br>

- Right click on the directory (ex: a folder called "all-my-unity-stuff" )

<br>

- Once the terminal is open and you see that the file **UnityHub.AppImage** is there (after you downloaded it)

<br>

#### Open the file you downloaded

<br>

- Type the following in your console **chmod +x UnityHub.AppImage** ( 🔴 remember that you have to open the terminal inside the folder that contains the App.image file)
